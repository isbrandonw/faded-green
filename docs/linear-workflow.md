# Linear Workflow

To best manage No Robot Co with Linear + Agentic workflow, I recommend the following "Hybrid" approach:

1. Structure
Since you don't have active Cycles yet, we should set up a basic rhythm.

Projects: We use the "No Robot Co" project (created) for high-level goals.
Cycles: I recommend 1-week or 2-week active cycles to keep focus tight.
Views: Use the "Active Cycle" view to see what's on fire now.
2. The "Agentic" Loop (How we collaborate)
This is the most powerful part. Instead of you manually updating everything:

1. You define the "What": Chat with me or create brief issues in the Inbox/Backlog.
2. I handle the "How":
    - I can assign myself issues.
    - I will create branches including the Issue ID (e.g., nomad/CON-7-docker-setup). Linear will automatically link these to the issue.
    - I will move tasks to In Progress when I start and Done when verified.

3. Immediate Action Plan
We have two open tasks. Here is how I suggest we tackle them to demonstrate this flow:

Phase A: Foundation (Current)
